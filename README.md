Airport Challenge
=================

Create an airport and land planes there. 

##### Creating an airport
You can create an airport with a default capacity of 35 without passing any arguments:
```
heathrow = Airport.new
```
Or you can specify a capacity by passing in an integer as an argument, like so:
```
heathrow = Airport.new(200)
```
